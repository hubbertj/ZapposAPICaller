ZapposAPICaller
===============

This was a test that Zappos had me do, it will show you how to use their current API. The Java program opens a HTTPConnection to the Zappos API. It will requies serveal SKU# and recieve a JSON object back. It then parses through the JSON data and retrives the image url. Then it will open up a URL connection and download the SKU images.
